# Challenge Bypass Extension

Tests: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/privacypass/challenge-bypass-extension.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/privacypass/challenge-bypass-extension)

The Privacy Pass extension implements the Privacy Pass protocol for providing a
private authentication mechanism during web browsing. Privacy Pass is
currently supported by Cloudflare to allow users to redeem validly signed tokens
instead of completing CAPTCHA solutions. The extension is compatible with
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-pass/ajhmfdgkijocedmfjonnpjfojldioehi)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-pass/)
(v48+). An example server implementation that is compatible with this extension
is available [here](https://github.com/privacypass/challenge-bypass-server).

In effect, the extension enables users to less frequently redo CAPTCHAs _from sites
implementing the Privacy Pass protocol_. The extension doesn't show if the protocol is
active or not. Not all users or websites use this, also since this technology is not
yet well known. Best chance to try this out is if you're in a region that are deemed to
need CAPTCHAs, and visit a CloudFlare site, like the example http://captcha.website/
If, by visiting, you don't get any CAPTCHA, you're welcome to hang around anyway and
learn more about this technology!

The Privacy Protocol is based on a realization of a 'Verifiable, Oblivious
Pseudorandom Function' (VOPRF) first established by [Jarecki et
al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/650.pdf). For a technical description of the
protocol see the [PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md). We also detail the entire
protocol and results from this deployment in a [research
paper](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/popets/2018/3/article-p164.xml)
that appeared at PETS 2018 (Issue 3).

__The protocol has received extensive review, but this extension is a
work-in-progress and we regard all components as beta releases. In particular in
v1.0 of the extension some features are not fully implemented (e.g. DLEQ proof
verification).__

__We hope to address a significant number of existing issues in a future release
of the extension. Users can also install the latest branch of master into their
browser to use a newer version.__ 

We welcome contributions from the wider community. Also feel free to notify us
of any issues that occur. Pull requests and reviews are welcome and encouraged.

## Quickstart
**Requires installation of a
[JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for

```

## Useful documentation

Documentation for the protocol, workflow and extension components.

- [Protocol](docs/PROTOCOL.md)
- [Extension implementation](docs/EXT_PROTOCOL_IMPL.md)
- [Configuration options](docs/CONFIG.md)
- [Supported "hash to curve" algorithms](docs/HASH_TO_CURVE.md)

## Development

- `git clone https://github.com/privacypass/challenge-bypass-extension.git`
- `git submodule update --init`
- Directory:
    - `src`: The source files that are used for establishing the extension.
        - `ext`: Source files that are specific to the extension.
        - `crypto`: External source files that provide cryptographic
          functionality.
            - `sjcl`: sjcl submodule.
            - `keccak`: Browserified implementation of Keccak taken from
              <https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/keccak>.
    - `addon`: Extension directory.
    - `test`: Test scripts for using the jest integration test framework.
    - `docs`: Documentation.
- Commands:
    - `yarn install`: Installs all dependencies.
    - `build:all`: Builds all source files (including sjcl) and compiles them
      (using closure) into minified versions that are kept in `addon/scripts`.
    - `test:all`: Compiles all source files, excluding `browserUtils.js`, and
      compiles them (using closure) into test_compiled.js. Runs sjcl tests and
      the jest test framework for the extension.
    - `build:ext`: Builds all extension source files and compiles them (using
      closure) into bg_compiled.js.
    - `test:ext`: Builds all extension source files, excluding sjcl.
      `browserUtils.js`, and compiles them (using closure) into bg_compiled.js.
      Runs the jest test framework for the extension.
    - `test:ext-quick`: Runs the jest test framework for the extension.
    - `build:sjcl`: Builds sjcl.
    - `test:sjcl`: Runs the sjcl tests.
    - `test:watch`: Runs test:all using the jest --watch flag.
    - `lint`: Lints the source files.
    - `dist`: Zips the extension files.

### Firefox

- Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
- Click 'Load Temporary Add-on' button
- Select manifest.json from addon/
- Check extension logo appears in top-right corner and 0 passes are stored (by
  clicking on it)
- Go to a web page supporting Privacy Pass where internet challenges are
  displayed (e.g. https://captcha.website)
- Solve CAPTCHA and check that some passes are stored in the extension now
    - captcha.website cannot be bypassed (this is only for gaining passes)
- Go to a new website supporting Privacy Pass that ordinarily displays a
  challenge
- Check that the website is displayed correctly without human interaction (more
  than one pass may be spent)
    - No interaction with a CAPTCHA page should occur, for instance

### Chrome

Same as above, except the extension should be loaded at `chrome://extensions`
instead.

## Plugin overview

The following script files are used for the workflow of Privacy Pass and are
found in `addon/scripts`. They are compiled into a single file
(`compiled/bg_compiled.js`) that is then loaded into the browser.

- src/ext/
	- listeners.js: Initialises the listener functions that are used for the webRequest and webNavigation frameworks.
	- background.js: Determines the bulk of the browser-based workflow for Privacy Pass. Decides whether to initiate the token issuance and redemption phases of the protocols.
	- browserUtils.js: General utility functions that are used by background.js. We separate them so that we separate the specific browser API calls from the actual workflow.
	- config.js: Config file that decides the workflow for Privacy Pass
	- content.js: (currently unused) Content script for reading page html
	- token.js: Token generation and storage procedures
    - issuance.js: Specific functions for handling token issuance requests from
      the extension and corresponding server responses
	- redemption.js: Specific functions for construction redemption requests

- src/crypto/
	- local.js: Wrapper for extension-specific cryptographic operations
	- sjcl.js: Local copy of SJCL library
  - keccak.js: Local implementation of the Keccak hash function (taken from
    <https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/keccak>).

Files that are used for testing are found in `test/`. These test files use their
own compiled test file in `compiled/test_compiled.js`. The only difference is
that src/etx/browserUtils.js is removed for better comptability. Functions from
this file are mocked during test execution.

## Cryptography

Cryptography is implemented using the elliptic-curve library
[SJCL](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl) and compression of points is
done in accordance with the standard SEC1. This work uses the NIST standard P256
elliptic curve for performing operations. Third-party implementers should note
that the outputs of the hash-to-curve, key derivation, and point encoding
functions must match their Go equivalents exactly for interaction with our
server implementation. More information about this will be provided when the
edge implementation is open-sourced.

## FAQs

### What do I have to do to acquire new passes?

* Click "Get More Passes" in the extension pop-up (or navigate to
  "https://captcha.website").
* Solve the CAPTCHA that is presented on the webpage
* Your extension should be populated with new passes.

### Are passes stored after a browser restart?

Depending on your browser settings, the local storage of your browser may be
cleared when it is restarted. Privacy Pass stores passes in local storage and so
these will also be cleared. This behavior may also be observed if you clear out
the cache of your browser.
